Welcome to the **Simon Game**—a fun, fast-paced game where you need to remember and repeat color sequences. Think you've got what it takes to beat the game? Let’s find out!

## What Is This?
Simon is a simple but challenging memory game. You press a key to start, and the game will flash a color sequence. All you need to do is **repeat** the sequence by clicking the correct colored buttons. Sound easy? Just wait until the sequences get longer and faster!
